Significance Level (Œ±): 0.05

HYPOTHESIS 1: TEMPORAL FRAUD PATTERNS (NIGHT VS DAY)
------------------------------------------------------------
H0: Night hours do NOT have higher fraud rates than day hours
H1: Night hours have significantly higher fraud rates than day hours

Sample Sizes:
  Night (0-5h): 1,486,393 transactions
  Day (6-23h): 5,997,373 transactions

Fraud Rates:
  Night: 0.5028 (50.28%)
  Day: 0.1246 (12.46%)

Statistical Test Results:
  Test: Z-test for proportions (one-tailed)
  Z-statistic: 1032.5336
  P-value: 0.000000
  Decision: REJECT H0

Effect Size:
  Cohen's h: 0.8549
  Interpretation: Very large effect
  95% CI for difference: [0.3774, 0.3791]

Conclusion:
  ‚úÖ Night hours have significantly higher fraud rates than day hours
  üìà Night fraud rate is 4.04x higher

HYPOTHESIS 2: WEEKEND VS WEEKDAY FRAUD PATTERNS
------------------------------------------------------------
H0: Weekend fraud rate does NOT exceed weekday rate by 25-40%
H1: Weekend fraud rate exceeds weekday rate by 25-40%

Sample Sizes:
  Weekend: 1,929,663 transactions
  Weekday: 5,554,103 transactions

Fraud Rates:
  Weekend: 0.1997 (19.97%)
  Weekday: 0.1997 (19.97%)
  Actual increase: 0.01%
  Target range: 25-40%
  In target range: NO

Statistical Test Results:
  Test: Z-test for proportions (two-tailed)
  Z-statistic: 0.0709
  P-value: 0.943494
  Statistical significance: NO
  Practical significance: NO

Effect Size:
  Cohen's h: 0.0001
  Interpretation: Small effect
  95% CI for difference: [-0.0006, 0.0007]

Conclusion:
  ‚ùå No significant difference between weekend and weekday fraud rates

HYPOTHESIS 3: BIMODALITY OF FRAUD TRANSACTION AMOUNTS
------------------------------------------------------------
H0: Fraud amounts do NOT show bimodal distribution in extreme percentiles
H1: Fraud amounts show bimodal distribution in extreme percentiles

Sample Size: 1,494,719 fraudulent transactions

Amount Statistics:
  Mean: $118,773.59
  Median: $5,626.06
  Std: $347,542.93
  Skewness: 7.0708
  Kurtosis: 75.0094

Percentile Analysis:
  1st percentile threshold: $0.76
  95th percentile threshold: $704,046.24
  Extreme percentile concentration: 6.0%

Statistical Test Results:
  Hartigan's Dip Test:
    Statistic: 0.008770
    P-value: 0.000000
    Result: Multimodal evidence
  Chi-square Concentration Test:
    Statistic: 0.1678
    P-value: 0.919543
    Result: Uniform distribution
  Chi-square Independence Test:
    Statistic: 564681.0426
    P-value: 0.000000
    Result: Fraud rate varies by amount group

Overall Assessment:
  Supporting tests: 2/3
  Evidence strength: STRONG

Conclusion:
  ‚úÖ Strong evidence for bimodal distribution in extreme percentiles
  üìà Fraud amounts are concentrated in very low and very high ranges

OVERALL SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------
Hypothesis 1 (Temporal Patterns): SIGNIFICANT
Hypothesis 2 (Weekend Patterns): NO PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Hypothesis 3 (Amount Bimodality): STRONG EVIDENCE
